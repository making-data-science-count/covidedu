<h2 style="font-style: italic;"><strong>MIDLAND DISTRICT NEWS</strong></h2>
<br><br><h3>ADMINISTRATORS ADDRESS COVID19 SITUATION - APRIL 17</h3>

<p>To our families,

</p>
<p>Today, Governor Kim Reynolds announced that Iowa schools would remain closed through the remainder of the school year due to the Covid-19 virus.  This means that Midland will be closed through our 2019-2020 calendar school year which ends on May 22.  This closure also means that all spring sports will be canceled.  Governor Reynolds announced that summer sports are still under evaluation.  We are looking for a decision on or about June 1.
</p>
<p>Midland will continue to provide our voluntary continuous learning through May 22. We will provide information to our families in May about a process for returning school computers and other items as well as for students to collect their personal items from lockers and classrooms.
</p>
<p>At this time, we will be able to continue our breakfast and lunch food program to children age 1 - 18.  If you have children and would like to be added to the food list, please contact Carol Guenther at 563-357-1524.  
</p>
<p>More information will be coming from the school district as we receive guidance from the state.  We miss seeing our students and hope that our families are doing well and staying healthy.
</p>
<p>Sincerely,
</p>
<p>Todd Hawley, Superintendent
</p>
<p>Carol Guenther, Secondary Principal
</p>
<p>Deanna Martens, Elementary Principal

<br></p>
<p><strong>MORE INFO....</strong>

</p>
<p>No decisions have been made on our summer driver's education class at this time.  That was scheduled to start in early June, but at this point we will have to take a wait and see attitude.  We won't hold the class until it is safe to do so.  We will let all those signed up know the schedule as soon as it is decided.  If your child needs to take the class be sure to email Michelle in the HS office to check that their name is on the list.  

</p>
<p>Unfortunately the Governor's orders also close down the Paul Petersen Fitnesss Center until further notice.  We apologize for all inconveniences this has created.  Hopefully the weather will be nice enough soon so we can all get out and take a walk or run outside. 

</p>
<p>Staff members miss our students very much and just want to give them the reassurance that they are still here for them.  Remember, staff members are always just an email away.  You can find all staff emails on our website under the building and StaffDirectory.  Staff members made this video to remind you that we are here for you:

</p>
<p>Let's all be leaders in this pandemic and practice social distancing.  That is the only way we will get through this serious situation as quickly as possible.  Don't go visit your friends, visit them via facetime or zoom! Stay home to safe Eagles!

</p>
<p>Don't forget your elderly relatives and friends.  They are lonely too, send them a letter, give them a call!  Be kind but be safe Eagle Nation!

<h3>HELPING STUDENTS THROUGH COVID19 HEALTH EMERGENCY</h3>

<p>For students of all ages, it is important to recognize that the COVID19 virus will bring up lots of different feelings. First, we must validate those feelings.  For example, if your student states they are scared.  Acknowledge their feelings and let them know it is okay to feel that way.  Second, ensure that everyone in your home is getting information from valid sources such a  the CDC or the Iowa Department of Public Health.  Limit the amount of time your child is engaging in receiving information regarding the virus.  

</p>
<p>Unknowns can create fear and anxiety. Right now there are lots of unknowns.  In order to help your student build resilience, create a routine for them and stick to it.  Routine and structure create a sense of safety because your student will know what to expect.  This is important for your teenagers as well. 

</p>
<p>Ways to help your teen adjust: 
</p>
<p>-   Wake up at the same time every day consistently and get out of bed. 
</p>
<p>-   Resist the urge to stay up late gaming or watching Netflix. 
</p>
<p>-   Exercise daily.
</p>
<p>-   Read daily.
</p>
<p>-   Get dressed - even if you are not going anywhere.  
</p>
<p>-   Shower 
</p>
<p>-   Write letters to loved ones that might be in a secluded environment (nursing homes)
</p>
<p>-   Start a project you have wanted to do. 
</p>
<p>-   Limit screen time.

<h3>THANKS WYOMING PUBLIC LIBRARY FOR FREE BOOKS!</h3>

<p>We want to extend our thanks to the Wyoming Public Library and librarian Nikki Rushford for her efforts to get students free books before this break.  When students came in to pick up their laptops and other items on Monday, March 16th they were allowed to chose free books from the library's overstock.  We want to encourge our students to read over this break.  Thanks Nikki for your support of students!

<h3>SCHEPANSKI NAMED 2019-20 MIDLAND ATHLETIC BOOSTER OF THE YEAR!</h3>

<p align="center"><image src="./Modules/Gallery/MiscPics/schepanski.jpg" width="350px"></image></p>
<p>Congratulations to Daryl Schepanski, the sports writer for the Anamosa Journal-Eureka who was named the 19-20 Midland Athletic Booster of the Year at their winter sports banquet recently.  Pictured above with all of the Midland HS winter coaching staff.

</p>
<p>His nomination letter to the booster officers said "Daryl has not only faithfully covered Midland Athletics since the loss of our local publication, he continuously shows genuine interest in our kids and the way they are portrayed in the public eye through his position at the Anamosa Journal.  Daryl often covers many events from several schools all on the same day.  This often requires much travel and tight scheduling that must be nearly impossible to pull off at times.  With rare exception Daryl is always there to cover post season games.  Daryl's coverage between Midland, Springville and the Journal's home town of Anamosa, is very equitable and well done even when the schools find themselves in direct competition with each other."
  
</p>
<p>Thanks Daryl for your dedication to Midland!

<h3>2020 MIDLAND HALL OF FAME INDUCTIONS</h3>

<p>On Friday, January 31st we made our final 2020 Hall of Fame Inductions by recognizing <strong>Jerry Carstens and the 1993-94 Girls Basketball Team!</strong>

</p>
<p><strong>Jerry Carstens</strong> was a long time physical education teacher and coach.  He coached girls basketball and is currently the 9th most winning coach in Iowa High School Girls Basketball history at 685 wins against 246 losses.  He took teams to the state tournament in 1969, 1970, 1981, 1989, 1992 and 1994.  Jerry was inducted into the Iowa Girls Basketball Coaches Hall of Fame in 2002.  He coached here through the 2004 year.  Unfortunately Jerry passed away in October, so to accept the award were his wife Kathy and family members Scott, Barb and Jenna Harms, Brenda Leonard and her daughter Allison.  Coach C touched a lot of lives during his time at Midland.

</p>
<p align="center"><image src="./Modules/Gallery/HSPics/CarstensHallOfFame.jpg" width="350px"></image></p>
<p>The <strong>Midland 1993-94 Girls State Qualifying Basketball Team</strong> was our final inductee into this inaugural Hall of Fame Class.  They qualified for state under Coach Carstens.  This tournament was a historic event for the state of Iowa as it was the first year that the girls state tournament was all 5 on 5 player games.  Midland had the honor of playing in the first game of that tournament.  The team finished with a 19-5 record and a first round loss at the state tournament to Armstrong-Ringsted 37-32.  Unfortunately none of the team members were able to attend.  Those on the team included:  Julie Knake, Lisa Eganhouse Cantwell, Paula Brady Walsh, Kelly Erickson Ballou, Jessie Paarmann VonBehren, Nancy Tasker Davis, Tamara Ewoldt, Kelly Kleppe Doll, Kristy Loy

</p>
<p>A 6 on 6 exhibition girls basketball game was held on January 31st and we had 14 alumni players come back to play.  Tammie Widel Small did a mean imitation of Coach Carstens as coach.  Everyone had a great time and no one got hurt.  Thanks to Larry Meyer and Kirk Park for officiating the fun! Kathy Carstens enjoyed being surrounded by C's girls!

</p>
<p>On Saturday, January 25th during the John Byers Wrestling Tournament we recognized the first two Midland Hall of Fame recipients:  <strong>Betty Anderson and John Byers</strong>.

</p>
<p align="center"><image src="./Modules/Gallery/MiscPics/HOF1.jpg" width="260px"></image><image src="./Modules/Gallery/MiscPics/HOF2.jpg" width="240px"></image><image src="./Modules/Gallery/MiscPics/HOF3.jpg" width="210px"></image><image src="./Modules/Gallery/MiscPics/HOF4.jpg" width="240px"></image><image src="./Modules/Gallery/MiscPics/HOF5.jpg" width="350px"></image></p>
<p><strong>Betty Anderson </strong>has been a long standing member of the Midland School District. Over the years Betty has been involved in so much with the district including driving bus, a regular at many Midland sporting events, chaperoning dances, and so much more. Known as Grandma Betty to most people in the district, Betty has always been willing to help any student in any way she can. To this day, Betty attends many events within the district and we look forward to having her around at our events for many years to come. Betty has contributed to the success of so many athletes, fine arts and general Midland students over the years. Needless to say we surprised Betty and she was a little overcome with emotion.  Well deserved, CONGRATS BETTY!

</p>
<p><strong>John Byers</strong>, Mr. B as he was lovingly known, began his teaching career at Marble Rock, Iowa where he introduced the wrestling program to the district.  He then came to work at Midland High School where he stayed for over 35 years teaching Industrial Arts and Driver’s Ed as well as coaching football, wrestling, and track.  He was a compassionate and giving man who loved his family, students, players, and community.  Aside from his many years in the classroom and athletics, he was strong in faith as a Deacon for the Wyoming Presbyterian Church, an EMT for the Wyoming Ambulance along with his wife Mary, and a Centurion of the Mason’s (St. Charles Cornerstone Lodge 141).  In 1978 he was honored as the Class “A” Iowa Coach of the Year for Wrestling.  In 1992 he was inducted into the Iowa Wrestling Coaches and Officials Hall of Fame.  Unfortunately John passed away on November 21, 2016 so his three children were back to accept his award, thanks to Joel, Mimi and Beth for making time to attend!

<p>At the November school board meeting both our current Superintendent Todd Hawley and our former Superintendent Doug Tuetken were in attendance to present plaques of appreciation for both of our retiring school board members Clay Pestka and Terry Lineburg.

<h3>ATHLETIC UNION ASKING MALE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AND FOOTBALL PLAYERS TO COMPLETE SURVEY</h3>

<p>The IHSAA is requesting our cooperation in surveying every male student in our high school.

</p>
<p>They want every male to complete this survey regardless of whether othey play football or not.  The objective of this survey is to find out reasons why participation in football continues to decline.  We can all hypothesize reasons, but can only truly find out the real reasons by asking those who do not play and also surveying those that do play regarding why they play and what will continue to keep them out for football.  

</p>
<p>The survey will be made available electronically.  We just want parents to know what is coming, what is on the survey, and why they are doing it.  If you have any questions please contact the high school.

<h3>MIDLAND TO ADD MOVABLE STOP SIGN TO HIGHWAY 64 IN WYOMING</h3>

<p>October 9, 2019

</p>
<p>Dear Midland Community,

</p>
<p>We have been granted a movable stop sign by the Iowa Department of Transportation to be placed at the intersection of Highway 64 and Washington Street in Wyoming. This is a heavily traveled area by vehicles during the day. To make sure our students are safe crossing this specific intersection we felt it was important to pursue a permit for this movable stop sign. 

</p>
<p>We will have it out approximately between the hours of 7:00am-8:00am and 3:00pm-4:00 Monday through Friday, unless there is a day where the school has an early out or late start. Please be aware of this new traffic device and understand that the safety of our students is always a priority for us at Midland CSD. 

</p>
<p>If you have any questions please feel free to contact me at Midland High School.

</p>
<p>Sincerely,

</p>
<p>Superintendent, Todd Hawley

<p>Midland Schools wants to introduce you to our newest staff member at the District Office.  Brooke (Holmes) 
Scott will be working in a Human Resources roll two days a week as part of a sharing agreement with Monticello Schools. 

</p>
<p>When asked to share some information about herself Brooke said "I was born and raised in Monticello and graduated from Monticello High School in 2008. I received my A.A. from Kirkwood Community College in 2015 and will be finishing my B.A. this year from Upper Iowa University. My major is in Psychology and my minor is in Human Resources Management. I currently live in Anamosa with my husband Jasper, and our two boys. In my free time I enjoy spending time with my family, riding motorcycles, watching movies, and all things sports! Football is my favorite and I am a huge Michigan Wolverines fan! I also enjoy coaching my son's sports teams, including flag football, and tournament team baseball. I look forward to becoming part of the Monticello and Midland School District teams!"

<h3>SCHOOL BOARD MEETING NIGHT CHANGED</h3>

<h3>HEALTH REMINDER FOR STUDENTS ENTERING 7TH, 9TH &amp; 12TH GRADES FOR 2019-20 YEAR</h3>

<p>We want to remind parents of students entering 7th, 9th, and 12th grade that for the 2019-20 school year we will need the following information:

</p>
<p>7th grade (and older) students: parents must ensure student has received BOTH: Tdap (Tetanus/Acellular Pertussis) vaccination booster AND a Meningococcal vaccination on or after 10th birthday.

</p>
<p>9th grade students: parents must provide proof student has had a dental screening by a dental professional within the last 12 months

</p>
<p>12th grade students: parents must ensure student has received 2 DOSES of Meningococcal vaccine; or 1 dose if first dose was received at 16 years of age or older.  Technically the law states any 12th grader who has not rec'd their first meningococcal should NOT be able to attend school

</p>
<p>Please be sure to take care of these items this summer and get proof to the school office by August 23rd if you have not already done so.

</p>
<p>Thanks for your help with meeting these requirements, Christine RN

<h3>MIDLAND SCHOOLS IS IN NEED OF SUBSTITUTES!</h3>

<p>Midland School District is in need of teacher substitutes, paraprofessional substitutes, and janitorial substitutes.  Please contact the district office for more information on how you can help out our students!

<h3>MIDLAND TAKES ANOTHER STEP FOR STUDENT SAFETY</h3>

<p>During the 2019-20 school year any visitor to either school location will need to bring their drivers license or some other form of identification to get in the building and past the secretary in the office.  Midland will be implementing the Raptor system which scans a drivers education and checks it against the sex offenders lists.

</p>
<p>We apologize for any inconvenience this causes our visitors, but in this crazy world we live in the Midland Schools believes we need to take this step to keep our students even safer than ever.  If you have any questions please contact an administrator.

<h3>MIDLAND WELCOMES OLIN STUDENTS</h3>

<p>Midland and Olin have entered into a whole grade sharing agreement for the 2019-20 school year for students in grades 7-12.  We are excited to have this as an option for the Olin parents and students.  We look forward to a great partnership with Olin Schools.

<h3>SUPERINTENDENT SHARING AGREEMENT FINALIZED</h3>

<p>Midland is happy to announce that they will be sharing a superintendent with the Delwood School District for the 2019-20 school year.  Though we are sad to lose the services of Doug Tuetken who was shared with Maquoketa Valley, when MV decided to share with a district closer to home Midland was forced to look for other arrangements.

</p>
<p align="center"><image src="./Modules/Gallery/MiscPics/Hawley.jpg" width="150px"></image></p>
<p>Todd Hawley is in his 2nd year as superintendent at Delwood where he also currently serves as principal.  In the new arrangement recently finalized, he will share his superintendent duties 50/50 between Delwood and Midland.  Delwood will hire a new principal for their elementary building.

</p>
<p>We look forward to a great working relationship with Mr. Hawley and Delwood schools. We thank Mr. Tuetken and Maquoketa Valley for a great two year working relationship!  We wish them well with their new arrangement also.

<h3>BUS SAFETY A MUST</h3>

<p>Our transportation personnel want to extend a huge thank you to all who follow proper traffic safety procedures when you encounter one of our buses out on the roads.  Our hearts go out to those who have been involved in tragedies involving stopped busses and bus stops recently.  It reminds us to post these reminders to all.

</p>
<p><image src="./Modules/Gallery/MiscPics/buspassrules.jpg" width="420px"><image src="./Modules/Gallery/MiscPics/buspassing.jpg" width="200px"><p>Our drivers do turn in a small number of drivers who pass inappropriately, don't stop for red lights, etc. each year.   Sheriff Graver says "That information goes to a pre-designated Trooper with the State Patrol who does the follow up and charges if there is probable cause to determine who was driving."  We don't want anyone to be in trouble, but better that than risk the lives of our students.

</p>
<p>Our students lives are FAR more important than a call or text or something, put down the phone, slow it down and follow the laws.  Let's all get safely to our destinations.

<h3>SCHOOL VOLUNTEERS, DRIVERS, CHAPERONES ALL NEED TO SIGN A FORM FOR THE SAFETY OF OUR STUDENTS</h3>

<p>Midland Community School District would like to thank you for showing interest in a rewarding way to serve students at all levels. Midland has new protocol regarding the safety of our students, we require background checks on all volunteers, chaperones, and drivers involved in school programs. 

</p>
<p>To begin, please completed the attached form (if applicable drivers license and insurance card) and background check form. Forms will need to be completed and returned to the district office. 

</p>
<p>Once forms are completed and returned to the district office (see below address), district office will process the forms. Please note the background check process (typically takes 2-5 days) will take longer during peak times, primarily at the beginning of the year and right after winter break. 

</p>
<p>After the background check is processed and cleared, volunteers, chaperones, and drivers are approved district-wide and are entered into a shared database accessible to office staff and building administrators.

<h3>CEREAL FOR ALL</h3>

<p>On May 28 every student at Midland Schools was given a huge box of Honey Nut Cheerios.  It was quite a site after school when every elementary student exiting the buses and every secondary student exiting the building was carrying a box of cereal.

</p>
<p><image src="./Modules/Gallery/MiscPics/cereal1.jpeg" width="300px"><image src="./Modules/Gallery/MiscPics/cereal2.jpeg" width="300px"><p>Nurse Gent got it all donated and answered the question "What's up with the cereal?"

</p>
<p>The cereal was donated to me by the food reservoir. There is nothing wrong with it, it is not expired.  They just got an over abundance of it in the warehouse right now.  Midland is one of 40 schools that participated in what I coined as "Operation Cereal drop".

</p>
<p>Thanks to Nurse Gent for always advocating for our students!  She is always on the look out for free services or items for our district.

<p>Some staff members, community members, board members and a student got together on Saturday, May 11 to help spruce up the Wyoming Center.  They planted some bushes and plants, laid some bark and picked up rocks.  The landscaping company then added top soil to other remaining areas to make those areas look better.  The building is looking more dressed up for graduation.

<h3>MIDLAND TAKES ANOTHER STEP FOR STUDENT SAFETY</h3>

<p>Beginning Monday, May 6, 2019 any visitor to either school location will need to bring their drivers license or some other form of identification to get in the building and past the secretary in the office.  Midland will be implementing the Raptor system which scans a drivers education and checks it against the sex offenders lists.

<h3>HELPING THE BECKER FAMILY</h3>

<p align="center"><image src="./Modules/Gallery/OJStaffPhotos/nbecker.jpg" width="100px"></image></p>
<p>On March 10th our 5th grade teacher and girls basketball coach Nathan Becker was injured while tree cutting and was airlifted to St. Luke's where he underwent surgery.  Mr. Becker is currently in the hospital where he is fighting to awaken from the coma.  

</p>
<p>Thanks to all who volunteered, donated, played and attended our Becker Basketball Fun Day on March 31st.  A great time was had by all.  We had an unbelieveable amount of baked items that all sold! We had a lot of basketball played and are guessing there were a lot of sore older muscles the next couple of days.  What a great show of support by our community.  A member of another community had this to say "Wow, this is incredible but not surprised, this is what your community does."  ABSOLUTELY!!!  We are MIDLAND and we are BECKER STRONG!  Thanks Eagles! 

</p>
<p>There will be a few different fundraisers coming up for the Becker family to help with his medical expenses.  Keep caring Midland....

</p>
<p>The Believe in Becker group will be raffling off 1 market pig processed at Lindley Locker in Center Junction during July or August 2019 through Midland Schools as well as 1/4 of a beef to be processed at Tipton Locker this summer.  Tickets are $5 each or 5/$20 and are available at Midland High School, Citizens State Bank or Franzen Tractors.  Thanks to Brock and Michelle Hansen for donating the pig, to Joe and Jackie Bisinger for donating the 1/4 beef and to Lindley Locker for donating 1/2 of the pig processing fees.  Drawing will be held at the June 29th benefit.

<h3>SUPERINTENDENT SHARING AGREEMENT FINALIZED</h3>

<p>Midland is happy to announce that they will be sharing a superintendent with the Delwood School District for the 2019-20 school year.  Though we are sad to lose the services of Doug Tuetken who was shared with Maquoketa Valley, when MV decided to share with a district closer to home Midland was forced to look for other arrangements.

</p>
<p align="center"><image src="./Modules/Gallery/MiscPics/Hawley.jpg" width="150px"></image></p>
<p>Todd Hawley is in his 2nd year as superintendent at Delwood where he also currently serves as principal.  In the new arrangement recently finalized, he will share his superintendent duties 50/50 between Delwood and Midland.  Delwood will hire a new principal for their elementary building.

</p>
<p>We look forward to a great working relationship with Mr. Hawley and Delwood schools. We thank Mr. Tuetken and Maquoketa Valley for a great two year working relationship!  We wish them well with their new arrangement also.

<h3>WEATHER CHANGES TO MIDLAND CALENDAR</h3>

<p>The winter of 2019 is certainly going to go down in the history books!  The decision to delay or cancel school is never an easy decision for a district, but we always want to make sure that the safety of our students and staff is forefront in our minds when making those decisions.  We recognize that a change in our schedule presents additional challenges for our families, so we want to limit the changes as much as possible. 

</p>
<p>By law, Midland students are required to attend school 1080 hours in a school year.  We have been closely monitoring those hours and find that we need to make additional adjustments to our calendar in order to make up time lost due to the winter storms Iowa is experiencing this year. 

</p>
<p align="center"><strong><a href="./PDFs/18.19%20Midland%20Calendar%20ALTERED%202.26.19.pdf">MCSD ALTERED MASTER CALENDAR</a></strong>
 
<br></p>
<p>Here are those remaining changes for your reference:
</p>
<p>Friday, April 19 - School in session.  Using day as a snow makeup.
</p>
<p>Wednesdays, 4/3 through 5/8 - No early dismissals for Teacher Professional Development.
</p>
<p>Wednesday, May 29 - Last full regular day of school if we meet our hours.
</p>
<p>Thursday, May 30 - MS/HS Remediation Day.
</p>
<p>Friday, May 31 - MS/HS Remediation Day.

</p>
<p>Of course if we have further no school days on account of weather or etc., this plan will need altered yet again.

<h3>MIDLAND ACCEPTING OPEN ENROLLMENT REQUESTS</h3>

<p>Open enrollment requests to attend Midland for the 19-20 school year can be submitted to the district office at PO Box 109, Wyoming, IA 52362 until March 1, 2019.  2019-20 Kindergarteners have until September 1, 2019.

</p>
<p>Each student only needs one open enrollment paper filled out for grades K or higher.  You do not need to fill one out each year.

</p>
<p>If you have a prekindergarten student who is on an IEP, we would then need a form for that student as well.  Regular ed PK students do NOT need a open enrollment form until they are attending kindergarten.

<h3>SUPERINTENDENT TUETKEN ADDRESSES BUS ROUTES ON GRAVEL ROADS</h3>

<p>Midland Parents:

</p>
<p>I am feeling exactly the same way you do regarding all the ice, snow, cold and fog.  I do want to thank all of you for your patience in dealing with our late starts, early outs and snow days.  I realize this has been challenging for all of us.  I did want to let all of our parents know that we have tried to stay away from just hard surface routes. The primary reason is trying to make this more convenient for all of you.  We do know that some of our gravel roads are in descent shape and have not been an issue for our bus drivers.  For those parents that we know we can get our bus to safely, we have done this for their convenience. Obviously we have some roads that have been impassable or unsafe.  Our drivers have contacted those parents on those roads to make other arrangements for a safe pick-up location.  Please know, that if you believe that it is unsafe for our bus to pick up your child, please contact the route driver to make other arrangements for a pick-up location.  If your unable to contact the bus driver, please give Mr. Stender a call at school and he will be more than happy to arrange a safe location for a pick-up.  I know is some instances Mr. Stender has been running the suburban to pick up some of our children.

</p>
<p>Again, thanks for patience and hopefully in a few weeks most of this winter weather will be behind us!

</p>
<p>Thank you for your patience,

<h3>A trophy carries dust, the memories last forever.</h3>

<p>With the remodeling and new construction project, we do not have the necessary room to store or display all of the trophies from previous years.

<h3>ISASP TESTING REPLACES IOWA ASSESSMENT TESTS THIS YEAR</h3>

<p>This year, our students will begin taking a new statewide assessment.  It will replace the Iowa Assessments.  The new test ISASP (Iowa Statewide Assessment of Student Progress) were developed by Iowa Testing Programs and the University of Iowa.  The assessment is designed to measure student learning outcomes as outlined in the Iowa Core Standards.  All districts in the State of Iowa are required to give the ISASP in a window during the final quarter of the school year.  

</p>
<p>The new test has some significant changes from the Iowa Assessments.  First, the test can be taken online or on paper.  Midland has decided that for the initial year, we will remain with a paper and pencil format for the test.  Second, the ISASP has fewer tests.  Students in grades 3 through 11 will be tested on Reading, Writing and Language, and Math.  Students in grades 5, 8, and 10 will be tested on Science.  Third, students will be required to write a passage from a prompt on the ISASP.  Finally, the test will be untimed.  Students will have as long as they need to complete each section.

</p>
<p>After the first of the year, the state is going to release some practice tests.  Students throughout the district will be given the opportunity to work through the practice test questions so that they can become familiar with the new question types and the new format of the test. 
 
</p>
<p>As in the past, families will receive student scores.  However, we have been notified by Iowa Testing Programs, that the scores will not be released to districts until sometime next fall.  Student growth, proficiency and readiness indicators will be reported to district at that time as well.

</p>
<p>The MS/HS will be testing from March 20  March 29.  All students should plan to be in attendance at this time.  HS students that attend Kirkwood should plan to be in the building in the building for testing all day on March 21 and 22.

<h3>HOW TO BE A GOOD SPORT</h3>

<p>If you have not heard, one of our JH wrestlers did something that showed very high character and selflessness. Logan Bicknese was able to give a win (Logan let him win) to an athlete from Lisbon that is less fortunate than him. Although Logan himself doesn't have a lot of wins yet this season, he saw the need to give this one away as it would mean more to the other athlete.  

</p>
<p>Here is a link to the tweet with a video:

<a href="https://twitter.com/MrNboots/status/1062505983962988545" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/MrNboots/status/1062505983962988545</a>

</p>
<p>Coach Gravel's wife Theresa said "It was awesome to watch. Logan really made Midland proud. And he was simply asked to give the kid some mat time and not pin him right away. Logan made the decision to give the kid the win on his own and told coach as he was taking the mat. It really was a proud Midland moment."  WTG Logan!  Keep up the great work!

<h3>BUS SAFETY A MUST</h3>

<p>Our transportation personnel want to extend a huge thank you to all who follow proper traffic safety procedures when you encounter one of our buses out on the roads.  Our hearts go out to those who have been involved in the recent tragedies involving stopped busses and bus stops recently.  It reminds us to post these reminders to all.

</p>
<p><image src="./Modules/Gallery/MiscPics/buspassrules.jpg" width="420px"><image src="./Modules/Gallery/MiscPics/buspassing.jpg" width="200px"><p>Our drivers do turn in a small number of drivers who pass inappropriately, don't stop for red lights, etc. each year.   Sheriff Graver says "That information goes to a pre-designated Trooper with the State Patrol who does the follow up and charges if there is probable cause to determine who was driving."  We don't want anyone to be in trouble, but better that than risk the lives of our students.

</p>
<p>Our students lives are FAR more important than a call or text or something, put down the phone, slow it down and follow the laws.  Let's all get safely to our destinations.

<h3>MIDLAND ADMINISTRATIVE TEAM ADDRESSES SAFETY CONCERNS AT WYOMING CENTER AT BUS TIME</h3>

<p>We have elementary parents arriving and then parking in the lot.  Students are then arriving on the buses and running through the parking lot trying to find their parents.  It is causing an unsafe situation especially when parents are then backing out of spaces and nearly hitting small children.

</p>
<p>Therefore, we are prohibiting parents from coming in and parking.  

</p>
<p>Elementary parents are not to enter parking lot until 3:20.  They need to give middle/high school parents time to pick up their students and clear the area.  We need them to enter the parking lot from the north Washington Street entrance.  Then, they should pull forward as far as they can in the "loop" - between the orange line and the sidewalk.  We will have staff available to help children find the vehicle that is waiting for them.  This will allow us to load children safely from the sidewalk and keep them out of the parking lot area.  

</p>
<p>We realize that we may not enough room for all parents in the "loop," but we need them to be patient and wait on Washington Street until space is available for them to enter.  

</p>
<p>Thanks, and please pass the word to parents.

<h3>CONSTRUCTION TODAY 6/28/18</h3>

<p>The mason workers completed their portion of the Bronson tribute wall which is across the hall from the concession stand and the gold gym.  It sure reminds us of the Bronson building, what a great idea!  The benches beside it are from the old flooring in the Bronson building.  Not sure if there will be any type of photo or commemorative info there or not.  Wait and see I guess.

<h3>BRONSON NEWS CLIPPINGS</h3>Thanks to retired Midland librarian Bob King who unearthed some news clippings about the Bronson building and then the auditorium/gymnasium which is currently the Commons or cafeteria at Wyoming.  The one seems to say the basement room was just a gymnasium in the Bronson building, not a swimming pool as rumored.

<p>The Cedar Rapids Republican article dated May 26,2014 shows where a $30,000 bond issue was passed to build the new building.  Bob says "In Iowa starting in 1894 women could vote on tax matters.  Women did not have the suffrage until 1920."  So they played a part in getting the bond issue passed as the news story indicates.

</p>
<p><image src="./Modules/Gallery/BronsonPics/BronsonNews5.26.14.jpg" width="325px"><p>The Monticello Express article dated August 6, 2014 tells how Reverend Dillon Bronson of Brookline, Massachusetts had offered to completely furnish the new school house with modern fixtures and apparatus, thus the building would be known as the James A. Bronson school.

</p>
<p><image src="./Modules/Gallery/BronsonPics/BronsonNews8.6.14.jpg" width="325px"><p>The Monticello Express article dated November 4, 1915 told how after an unavoidable delay in completion of the new school house, students and staff were able to finally move in on November 1, 1915. Mirroring our construction project they thanked the school board members who "are deserving of the thanks of every citizen of the town, as they have cheerfully given their time and attention to what is in most cases a thankless job."

</p>
<p><image src="./Modules/Gallery/BronsonPics/BronsonNews11.1.15.jpg" width="325px"><p>The Cedar Rapids Gazette article dated August 26, 1939 told of the dedication of the new auditorium-gymnasium on Sunday, August 27, 1939.  The $40,000 structure replaced the old town opera house which had been remodeled for school use when the gym in the school house became inadequate.  The new building ahs a playing floor of 78 x 40 feet.  Bleachers on one side and chairs can be set up on the 40 foot stage on the other.

</p>
<p><image src="./Modules/Gallery/BronsonPics/BronsonNews8.26.39.jpg" width="325px"><p>Thanks to Mr. King for digging up this interesting reading.  We are all learning history lessons through this construction project. 

</p>

<h3>SURPRISE UNCOVERED</h3>

<p>On Friday, June 8th the construction discovered a surprise, the construction guy said they broke through the classroom floor to find an area with small bleachers and then there is brick about 4-5 foot up the four walls with a wider brick topping it. We know there was a gymnasium on the West end of the Bronson building.  Rumor had it back when they were playing basketball on that floor that there was a swimming pool under that gymnasium floor. If anyone has photo proof of what was once there please share with us so we can solve this Bronson mystery.

Here I believe he was looking for it as he intentionally dropped the steps to get them to break and was digging around in that south stairs area.

</p>
<p><image src="./Modules/Gallery/BronsonPics/6.8.18.8.jpeg" width="325px"><image src="./Modules/Gallery/BronsonPics/6.8.18.9.jpeg" width="325px"><p>More bricks should be available for the public on Monday by the front entrance on a pallet by the gold bicycle rack.  If you would like, please take one brick as a commemorative piece of the Bronson building.  Please be courteous as we know many people want one.

</p>
<p>The bricks on pallets by the activities entry are saved to create a historical display with the old school bell on school grounds.  PLEASE do NOT take these.  There are security cameras by this exit that cover those, we hope none come up missing.  Thanks for your understanding on this, we feel it is important to preserve some of the Bronson heritage.  There have also been some benches made from some of the old flooring from the Bronson and those will be on display in the activities entrance near the gyms.

<h3>BRONSON LEVELED</h3>

<p>The 1914 Bronson building served the Midland District well for over 100 years.  On June 6 this is what remains of it.  

</p>
<p></p>
<p><image src="./Modules/Gallery/BronsonPics/6.6.18%201.jpeg" width="325px"><image src="./Modules/Gallery/BronsonPics/6.6.18%202.jpeg" width="325px"><p>Construction workers say they should have the remains separated and hauled away by around June 15th.  Then the area will be leveled and will become a much needed parking lot later this summer.    

</p>
<p>There are a few bricks available for those who wanted one to commemorate the building.  They are on a pallet by the main office door near the bike rack, please help yourself to one if you'd like.  They are available on a first come basis.

</p>
<p>This is the view from the corner of Green Street and Washington Street this morning:

We couldn't have done this without each of you.   

</p>
<p>The future looks bright for the Midland District, we are excited for the memories to be made in the new building addition.

<h3>AND THE MEMORIES CONTINUE</h3>

<p>Part two of a story written by 1984 Midland Alumni Marlys Thomas Barker.  You can also find her articles in the June 6th copy of the Anamosa Journal-Eureka.

</p>
<p>Other notes of interest shared with the writer about the Bronson building:

</p>
<p>From Joyce Fishwild, a longtime teacher and substitute teacher at Midland: "The ground (the school was built on) was given to the school district originally by Thomas Green...it was on Green Street...up from the creek. The building preceding the Bronson building was used from 1867 to 1914 when the Bronson building was completed. Bricks from the old building were cleaned and used to build the Diamond Garage on Main Street, that later became a drug store."

</p>
<p>From Kathy Park, a teacher who taught in the building: "I remember in the fall we would get a lot of wasps flying in and out of our windows. They lived in the bricks outside. By afternoon, there would be wasps sitting on the poles holding the lights to the ceiling. At the end of the day, I'd take a can of wasp spray and shoot them with it. The next morning, I'd pick up dead wasps and throw them away."

</p>
<p>From Pauline Antons: "I also recall the dusty chalk boards...my clothes always seemed covered with chalk dust...One classroom incident I'd like to forget was the day my string of pearls broke and rolled all over the floor. They kept rolling periodically because some were stuck in my clothing. How embarrassed I was, but students had their laugh of the day!"

</p>
<p>From Christi Stingley, former teacher: "I thought the building had a kind of charm about it. I would have preferred a new building, but I loved the big windows, since I'm an outdoors person...Air conditioning would have been nice on the hot days. I remember being a klutz, especially in heels, and tripping over the warped flooring in John Meyer's room especially. I remember the floors creaking constantly and being able to hear footsteps...If I went in to work in the evening, I remember it feeling kind of creepy..."

</p>
<p>From Peg Mineck, a teacher in the 1970s: "We made a time capsule in 1976, which I believe we hid in the built-in cupboard in my room. Not sure what ever happened to it."

</p>
<p>From Melissa Paulsen, former student who moved next door to the building: "We were able to get a large wooden window from the entryway, just inside the doors...to hang in our house."

</p>
<p>From Michelle Hansen, former student and now administrative assistant at Midland: "The building project began in April 2016 after the community passed the bond issue by two votes! The farm economy was doing well, and we were lucky it went through on the very first try. We had a good school board... Our superintendent I believe attended every single type of meeting in all seven communities in the six months leading up to the vote...telling people why we needed it." The groundbreaking for the new building was April 4, 2016.

</p>
<p>No doubt the memories of the Bronson building will come alive when the Wyoming Class of 1943 gathers on June 9. Joyce Fishwild said the following former students are among those expected to attend: Lorraine Moenk Denniston, Albert Storm, Bonnie Denniston and Ross Stickley.

<h3>TODAY WAS THE DAY, THE END OF THE BRONSON BUILDING - JUNE 4, 2018</h3>

<p>Today was the last day the Bronson building stood whole on Midland soil.  Half of it was demolished to make way for a parking lot, the rest will come down on June 5.  Many spectators stood around and watched and reminisced with stories of what went on in the building.  Some retired staff came back to see it as they had spent many years in it.

</p>
<p>The Bronson sign and the 1914 sign were saved prior to demolition.

<h3>A TRIBUTE TO BRONSON</h3>

 <image src="./Modules/Gallery/BronsonPics/Bronson%20Bldg.jpg" width="325px"><p>As the Bronson Building comes down, many recall fond memories of what happened within its walls

</p>
<p>By Marlys Barker, Contributing Writer

</p>
<p>Over the past century, hundreds of students, along with numerous teachers and other school staff, have passed through the doors and spent time between the walls of the "old Bronson building" in Wyoming.

</p>
<p>Completed in 1914, the historic school building -- which is presently coming down to make room for parking around a new state-of-the-art Midland School building -- was built in honor of James A. Bronson, who is known as the founding father of the town. Local history reveals that Bronson had the first general store "up on the hill" and then built the first block of Main Street. Bronson was also postmaster of Wyoming, not once, but twice, and a business leader in the community for many years.

</p>
<p>The historic three-story brick school building, bore Bronson's name, likely made a big impression in its day. Some would say that even as the building's been coming down, it's still impressive. The structure itself, however, is probably nowhere near as special as the memories that were made within it.

</p>
<p>"Teachers in the Bronson building became the best of friends," said longtime Midland teacher Pauline Antons. "Perhaps it was the hall duty on the first floor that made it happen. There, between classes, we chatted and laughed as we greeted students to their respective rooms."

</p>
<p>By "hall," Antons refers to the big open areas between the rooms of each floor. There were really no hallways in the building, just staircases, offices and rooms that were used for classes and other school purposes.

</p>
<p>For many years, the kitchen in the basement served lunches to students. Michelle (Mead) Hansen, a 1982 graduate of Midland and now the district's middle and high school administrative assistant, remembers how the aroma of Mrs. Storm's cinnamon rolls and other homemade goods filled the building. "Mrs. Storm made the best cinnamon rolls."

</p>
<p>As a student, Hansen remembers the walks back and forth between the Bronson building and the newer high school building, which was added across the street in 1956 to give the district more space. Many, many students took that "walk across Green Street" several times a day for over 50 years. And then, inside Bronson, there were the steps you would go up and down -- how many flights a day depended on your class locations. Antons, who substituted for the district after her retirement, said the steps, which she climbed a number of times to sub for Mr. Ahrendsen, are something she won't miss.

</p>
<p>But those steps were perfect conditioning for some of the school district's runners. Cody Barnes, a 2014 graduate of Midland, remembers doing track season circuit loops -- easily done because of the matching staircases to the front and back of the top two floors -- inside Bronson. Thankfully, none of the wood floors gave out during those training drills or from regular student/teacher activity in the building, which was in use until January of this year.

</p>
<p>"We had our sixth-grade classes in it, as well as Spanish, math, social studies and special education," said Hansen of the last classes ever held in Bronson.

</p>
<p>The building was, however, becoming increasingly structurally unsafe. "There was an area where the floor was pulling away from the wall," Hansen said.

</p>
<p>Barnes said he remembers how the walls seemed to be separating from the wood floors. "We had assumed for the past 20 years or so people had dropped pencils and pens and really any disposable items down the cracks, and we waited for the day for them to pile up and finally fill those holes and gaps," he recalled.

</p>
<p>Ultimately, school officials decided it would be cost-prohibitive to try to restore the Bronson building and keep it in use. "It would have needed all new electrical, as it certainly wasn't built with today's use of electricity in mind," Hansen said. No doubt, the building would also have needed lots of work to become ADA-compliant and meet other codes and technology needs of today's learners.

</p>
<p>But in its day, it was a great place to learn, and despite its growing "old building" issues, everyone shares their thoughts about the Bronson school with fondness.

</p>
<p>Kathy Park taught fourth grade in the Bronson building in the late 1980s and early 1990s. "My classroom was on the top floor in the southeast corner. Since it faced south, it was a warm room. The thermostat for that side of the building was in my room. When it got too warm, I'd turn the heat down." Her doing this would cool down the high school social studies room below her, though, and with high school students going in and out of the outside doors every hour, those rooms didn't stay as warm. "When they would get too cold below us, Ken Laffoon (who taught in the room below hers) would send one of his students to my door to say, 'Mr. Laffoon says to put another log on the fire!'"

</p>
<p>Another one of the unique qualities of the Bronson building was that it had housed students of almost every grade level at one time or another, and often both upperclassmen and elementary students co-existed in the building.

</p>
<p>Peg Mineck taught first grade on the top floor at the east end of the building from 1975 to 1977. She was next to the other first grade teacher, Aliceann Harkin Coon. "The two rooms had a door between them, which allowed Aliceann and I to co-teach and do a lot of things with our classes together," said Mineck, who also remembers her room had a fire escape door on the east wall, and two doors that came into it from the hallway.
</p>
<p><image src="./Modules/Gallery/MiscPics/Bronson%20Class.jpg" width="325px"><p>"The rooms were very spacious," she said, which gave teachers lots of room to do activities. It was also nice that high school French teacher, John Meyer, was on the first floor. "We had some very smart first graders and sent them down to the that floor on occasion (to work with Meyer) ... which gave Aliceann and me more time to work one-on-one with students who needed an extra boost."

</p>
<p>Christi Stingley (who was Miss Gehrt and then Mrs. Thompson while she was teaching in the district from 1979 to 1991) came to Midland straight out of college. She was in the Bronson building and for the first few years, she didn't even have her own classroom. "To my dismay, I had a desk in John Meyer's room," and she moved to wherever her classes were. "I remember having to run between buildings for my classes and struggling to stay organized."

</p>
<p>When she finally got her own room, it was in the Bronson building, next to Ken Smith, "Smitty" as all the kids and adults called him. Smitty, like the Bronson, was a relic, and some of Stingley's favorite memories are tied to him.

</p>
<p>"I remember vividly him coming to my room after school was dismissed and watching the kids board the bus (out of the big Bronson windows) as we visited and laughed about our day."

</p>
<p>And the saying,"Expect the unexpected," Stingley said, was exactly what it was like when Smitty was your teaching neighbor."  He had a chair on rollers that was gradually falling apart, but he liked the chair, so he kept using it. One day, however, it broke for good...the next thing I knew, my class and I heard a terrible crashing sound, followed by several parts of this chair being launched out his doorway...Since parts of the floors were warped, the parts landed in various locations. Apparently, Smitty was finished utilizing this chair."

</p>
<p>A community garage sale was held earlier this year, where many of the things still inside the building that weren't needed at the new building, were sold. After that, Hansen said a salvage company purchased rights to the rest of the building and got everything left in it. Once the building goes down, she said the company has agreed that community members who want can have one brick each from the building.

</p>
<p>Hansen has watched and taken many pictures as the salvage company has torn out the wooden floors, the big 2x12 floor joists and all other elements, as they've prepared to bring the building down, which was to start any day now by punching a hole in the roof and then into one side of the building, and pushing that side to the middle to bring the structure down. That event is or was expected to take place on a weekend or evening when no one was on school property or in the nearby daycare center.

</p>
<p>It's the end of a building, the end of an era in Wyoming's small-town history. When a building like this comes down, it's a reminder that time always marches on.

</p>
<p>"Being one of hundreds to have the privilege to teach in the Bronson building," said Antons, "makes me grateful that Wyoming had a family with such foresight and funds to support education in a most meaningful and generous way."

<p> <image src="./Modules/Gallery/MiscPics/Bronson%20Fire%20Escape.jpg" width="250px"><p>Melissa and Jordan Paulsen were married in 2016 and had some of their
wedding pictures taken at the Bronson building, which they moved next door
to as a married couple. It was also part of the school where they met. "I
knew we had to get some pictures of us at the place where we started, and
next to the place we ended up." Melissa said.
