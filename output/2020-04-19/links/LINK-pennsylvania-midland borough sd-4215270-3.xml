Your patience, support, and resilience during this unprecedented time is remarkable.  We are all in uncharted waters and navigating the best that we can as we receive information about COVID-19 and adjust to changing news.  I am in contact with our administration, staff and Board as we monitor information coming from the PA Department of Education, the GovernorÂ’s office, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the PA Department of Health.  With this in mind, please know that the safety and education of the students in the Midland Borough School District is of the upmost importance to us.  Our staff is working diligently to implement education plans to be available to our students and families.  The mandatory shutdown by the GovernorÂ’s Office has allotted us time to put academics in place so we are up and ready to go.  We know this transition will have hiccups and take time to work out all the details but please know we will work with you to rectify any issues you may be having.At this time, we are preparing for the possibility of a long term closure of school buildings and the need for social distancing across every county in Pennsylvania.  Therefore, this means we want continued quality education delivered to our families while we weather this storm.  This may include classes delivered on-line and/or physical packets for students to complete.  These decisions are being researched and we will be reaching out to our families with information that will address the needs of all of our students so we may deliver educational instruction for their individualized academics.  The District is still offering free breakfast and lunch to all children 18 years of age and younger.  Grab and go meals are available at the following times and locations:			11:00 am	1st Street/Spring Lane					Four Mile Daycare Center 13th Street			11:30 am	The Center 758 Ohio Ave					Midland Heights at the Fire HallWe will be updating our website as we receive information so please go to  HYPERLINK "http://www.midlandpa.org" www.midlandpa.org for District information.  There you can connect to teacher webpages, lesson plans, and send an email to them.  We will also be connecting with you through our mass notification system so if you miss a call please check your voicemail messages.  Moving forward, please know how proud I am of you and the new role you are in.  You now have to navigate a constant stream of information that changes quickly, your children will have a new academic instruction delivery, social distancing has changed how we communicate with family and friends, and your household has had to adjust to all of this for the safety of your family and your community.  ItÂ’s overwhelming, challenging, and frightening and you are doing a fantastic job!We will be in contact with you by Wednesday, March 25, 2020 with an update on how instruction will be delivered.  In the meantime, please stay safe and healthy.Sincerely yours,Sean D.
