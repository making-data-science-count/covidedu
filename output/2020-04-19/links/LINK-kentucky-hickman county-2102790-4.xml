This will continue for the next two weeks as suggested, by the Governor and the Commissioner of Education.  At that point, we will be communicating any further changes to the instructional days as more information comes in.  The cause for this change in instructional method is due to the concern for the spread of the COVID19 virus and the advice of the Kentucky Department of Education, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention as well as the Kentucky Department of Public Health. This message is to keep parents and families informed and up-to-date with information regarding our plan processes.Regular instruction will now be delivered by packet and technological device during the day while students remain at home.  Your child will be coming home today with information on how they will be receiving instruction from their individual teachers and principals over the next two weeks.  More information on this will be forthcoming as students continue instruction through this method.  While we would much rather be in regular session, our district is doing its very best to provide the best possible instruction available during this unprecedented time. All planned school events, trips and sporting events will be cancelled during this time as well.  The KHSAA has also issued a Â“dead periodÂ” mandating of no athletic participation of any sort until April 12th.  Any information as to when these events will resume should be communicated once information is provided to us by the Governor, KHSAA and/or our state health agencies.To assist families who are in need of breakfasts and lunches during this time, the school cafeterias will be available for families to pick up and take home meals.  Satellite sites will also be set up in the community to assist in meal distribution as we see necessary.  Information on this service will be distributed by our Â“One CallÂ” and Remind systems this afternoon.  Parents/guardians will need to contact our Food Service Director, Megan Adams at (270) 653-2341 Ext. 2039 to place a request for accommodations.Under the guidance of the CDC, we continue to urge everyone to follow best practices for staying healthy while schools are not in session. For more detailed information about COVID-19 and CDC guidelines please visit  HYPERLINK "https://www.cdc.gov/" https://www.cdc.gov/ and  HYPERLINK "https://chfs.ky.gov/agencies/dph/Pages/covid19.aspx or call 1-800-722-5725" https://chfs.ky.gov/agencies/dph/Pages/covid19.aspx or call 1-800-722-5725.Thank you for all your cooperation and support of our schools as well as the health of our community.  We look forward to having everyone back in regular session as soon as possible.Sincerely,Casey Henderson, SuperintendentHickman County Schools[Type a quote from the document or the summary of an interesting point.
