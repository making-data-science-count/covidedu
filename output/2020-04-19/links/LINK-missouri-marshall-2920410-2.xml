Vest St.Marshall, MO 65340      PH:  660-886-7414 HYPERLINK "mailto:cmaher@marshallowls.com" cmaher@marshallowls.com March 19, 2020Dear MPS Parents and Patrons:Needless to say, the events of the last week are an uncharted territory. These uncertain times have brought about the certainty, however, that we have tremendous people working for Marshall Public Schools.  For example, the huge task of organizing food service for our students was brilliantly handled by our Social Work Department, Opaa! Food Service, Grace Durham, and many volunteers.  AND Â– it was planned and implemented in one day!  We began serving meals to MPS student TODAY!  Marshall Public Schools will continue to work with the Saline County Health Department, the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, and within the Center for Disease Control to monitor the situation and make decisions in the best interests of the entire Marshall community.  MPS is committed to providing meaningful and equitable course work to all students and since internet may not be accessible to all families, enrichment activities will be available for the students of Marshall Public Schools both digitally and in paper form.  If your family would prefer to have paper copies for pick up or delivery, please contact your childÂ’s building administration.Â  Students will NOT be penalized during this time for missed connections, assignments, quizzes, or attendance.Â Learning goes on and, although school looks very different, we are trying our best to provide the best for our students in this emergency situation.  We know it wonÂ’t be perfect and weÂ’ll learn every day what to do and what not to do.  We will get through this together!  The MPS Administrative Team met today and worked on the path to provide our students with meaningful learning opportunities.  We also discussed how to support teachers and staff.  Over the next few days, we are planning days for encouraging the community to engage with us in several ways.  Those are:DATE                       EVENTThursday, March 19th - Principals and office staff in buildings.  Buildings remained closed.Friday, March 20th Â–       Principals and office staff in buildings.  Students may pick up medicine from their building. Monday, March 23rd -     Principals and office staff in buildings.  Teachers meet and plan. Students may pick up personal belongings.    Tuesday, March 24th -     Principals and office staff in buildings.  Teachers meet and plan. Students may pick up personal belongings.MPS Board of Education meeting.

Friday, March 27th            Originally scheduled spring break. Not a scheduled workday. A summary of what the different MPS schools have planned is available upon request.  Please email me at the address above to have the summary sent to you either over email or in hard copy. Also, please call the building principals for more specific information.  Thank you to the Marshall community for the help and support you have so generously shown!  Sincerely,M.
