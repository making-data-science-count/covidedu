<p>Today’s ongoing coverage of the coronavirus pandemic’s impact on Kansas:</p>
<br><p>• 10:11 p.m. Wednesday: The National Beef processing plant in Dodge City confirmed that one of its employees has tested positive for COVID-19. The employee has not been in the facility since late last week and is now in quarantine, National Beef said in a statement to the Dodge City Daily Globe.</p>
<br><p>• 6:38 p.m. Wednesday: While much research is slowing down due to the global outbreak of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, Kansas State’s agricultural researchers are moving forward with research. "Let’s just say that there have been challenges," said Marty Draper, the associate dean for research in the College of Agriculture and associate director of K-State Research and Extension</p>
<br><p>• 5:08 p.m. Wednesday: The Shawnee County Health Department has confirmed 53 COVID-19 cases with 40 of those still active. According to the health department’s website, 10 people have recovered and three people have died.</p>
<br><p>• 4:58 p.m. Wednesday: The executive director of the Kansas Shrine Bowl, an annual All-Star game featuring the state's top outgoing high school football seniors, says he is hopeful the July 18 event at Washburn's Yager Stadium will be played as scheduled. "If you’d had this call a couple weeks ago, it would have been a complete mess. I think things have progressed and I’m more hopeful today than I was yesterday, and I hope that continues," said B.J. Harris.</p>
<br><p>• 3:53 p.m. Wednesday: A Republican-controlled panel of Kansas legislative leaders voted to overturn the executive order issued by Gov. Laura Kelly to limit attendance at church gatherings and funerals. The Legislative Coordinating Council voted 5-2 along party lines to rescind the order as Republican leaders argued the order violated federal and state constitutional protections for freedom of religion. Clay Britton, the governor's chief counsel, said the governor’s order "needed to be done." "It was an issue of life and death," he continued.</p>
<br><p>• 3:02 p.m. Wednesday: Modernization of the state’s unemployment IT system must be a top priority of post-COVID-19 recovery efforts, argues The Capital-Journal editorial board. The volume of applicants is unprecedented and any system would be strained in these unconventional times, but the efforts to process benefits are greatly strained by outdated technology.</p>
<br><p>• 2:33 p.m. Wednesday: The University of Kansas Health System St. Francis campus announced a "modest reduction of positions" and furloughs to mitigate the impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the hospital’s financial footing. Under the plan, 2.3% of the St. Francis workforce, or 29 employees, will be laid off. Another 16.9%, or 235 full- or part-time employees, will face furloughs.</p>
<br><p>• 1:47 p.m. Wednesday: One of the hardest and best lessons Capital-Journal contributor Nicolas Shump learned after his divorce was that he could stand on his own, the longtime northeast Kansas-based writer and educator details. He encourages you to use this time and temporary solitude to appreciate your gifts and treasures and to cultivate your own happiness.</p>
<br><p>• 1:30 p.m. Wednesday: Sabetha baseball standout Gabe Garber lost his senior season due to COVID-19 cancellations, also missing out at an opportunity to three-peat. "We had a bunch of momentum from last year. We knew we would be confident but also that everyone was going to give us their best shot. There was going to be a lot of pressure on us as well. We knew it was going to be a battle, but we were ready for it," said Garber, who will join Kansas' football program next year as a preferred walk-on.</p>
<br><p>• 12:04 p.m. Wednesday: With the Wellington Recreation Center temporarily closed, fitness classes there are going online and people participate virtually from their homes. "I’m way out of my comfort zone," acknowledged Cindy Tracy, who is conducting her Zumba classes through Facebook Live streaming.</p>
<br><p>• 12:02 p.m. Wednesday: Thinking about the future tugs at small business owners even as they struggle to keep everyone employed and insured, writes Karyn Page, president and CEO of Kansas Global Trade Services and the chairwoman of ITAC-9. "However, never has there been a more crucial time to think of new ways to grow and generate revenue," she continues. "This, like all things, will pass and we need to get ready now to grow later."</p>
<br><p>• 11:34 a.m. Wednesday: Pratt Community College yoga instructor Trisha Jackson has continued her teachings digitally. "One of the best things about our class is the sense of community. I really enjoy the sense of connection and how they are sharing and responding," Jackson said.</p>
<br><p>• 11:06 a.m. Wednesday: Topeka Unified School District 501 clarified it plans to work with local partners to continue provision of food daily at 10 sites in the city as well as increase its focus on making food available at pantries. A news release late Tuesday included details about where food would be available once it handed off execution of the grab-and-go lunch program next week to local charitable partners.</p>
