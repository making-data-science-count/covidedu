We are confident this decision is in the best interest in of our students, staff, and community.  We will continue to work hard to provide learning opportunities for all Owls and look forward to the day weÂ’re all back to school!The Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) has sent advice to school districts to help navigate these uncharted waters, including the care of families who are struggling.  Our district was putting this advice into practice before it was recommended at the state level!  Marshall certainly has many reasons to be proud of the outstanding efforts by MPS employees in providing help and support to all families and homes, no matter how different they may be.Â  WeÂ’re very proud of the work grown-up Owls have done the past few days to reach out to kids and make them the priority.Â  Â Here are examples of the just a few of the many ways demonstrating just how great MPS and its people really are:Â DESE notes that learning for all students will be better served by attending to equity and access.Â  So many in the school district and community have worked tirelessly over the past few days to put this in motion and to make sure ALL students have access not only to technologyÂ but to great teachers and staff who really care about them.Â Â 2)  DESE asks that we don't send packets of busywork or meaningless worksheetsÂ into homes during kidsÂ’ time at home.Â  MPS teachers have worked long and hard to put together opportunities for enrichment and advancement, without penalizing students.  The activities are planned to help parents (who are, no doubt,   feeling stress and uncertainty) by sharing resources, ideas, and strategies for worthwhile activities. 3) The message from the state is:Â  "Learning at home should be valued as an opportunity to extend student thinking.Â”  From the very beginning of this crisis, MPS teachers have viewed this time away from school as a chance to enhance and support learning with people and resources available at home, with as much family engagement as each individual familyÂ’s case will allow.4)Â  The communication from the state gives us this good advice:Â Â Extend compassion to those around you during high-stress times, including yourself.  MPS and Marshall people were practicing putting others before themselves the first day of the crisis and we continue to have student and parent wellbeing in the forefront of the efforts.  At the same time, our MPS employees need to take time to take care of themselves and their own families.  We continue to work in our own lives and together with others in such profound ways.Â  It is very humbling to witness the very caring andÂ courageous endeavors of so many.  The heart and soul of these endeavors pour into and flow from our schools!Our mission for the days ahead is:Protect and Provide(Protect the well-being of all.
