Morning buses will run their regular routes, only two (2) hours later, and afternoon buses will run at their normal times.As when the District calls for a school closure, a late start will be announced on local television and radio stations no later than 6:00 a.m.  Also, the late start or school closure information will also be posted on the District web page.   Weather conditions are checked by the transportation coordinator and the superintendent between 4:30 a.m. and 5:30 a.m.  In determining if school will be cancelled, several factors are considered: rate of snowfall; amount snowfall accumulation; temperature; conditions of highways; and weather forecasts.  Safety is the primary consideration in deciding to hold, delay the start, or close school.Occasionally, conditions are quite poor during the early morning hours but change by 8:00 a.m.  When weather forecasts suggest that this may be the case, the District may announce a delayed start for all of our schools: Clear Creek High School; Clear Creek Middle School; Carlson Elementary School; King-Murphy Elementary School; and Georgetown Community School.  Please note that this will be a two-hour delay and we suggest that you and your students adjust your schedules accordingly.  We try and make all announcements to media before 6:00 a.m., whether it is a delay start or a school closure.If a delayed start has been announced, but weather conditions do not improve, school closure announcements will be made between 7:00 a.m. and 8:00 a.m.  Remember to watch local/regional television and/or listen to local radio stations for the status of school on those days.  A school delay may turn into a school closure if the weather conditions do not improve.Media organizations announcing EMERGENCY CLOSURES for the DistrictRadio Stations850 KOAKYGOKool 105Mix 10092.5TV StationsWB2 NewsNews 4News 7News 9FOX 31 News                                        $  B  M  N  O  P  r  u  z  Â•  Â»  Ã‘  Ã§  Ãª  n	  	  Âƒ	  Â‡	  Â–	  Â 	  Â°	  Ã™	  Ã	  Ã§
