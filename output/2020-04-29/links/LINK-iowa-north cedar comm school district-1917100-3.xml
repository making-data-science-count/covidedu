	<div class="nl-title">North Cedar School Board Monthly Highlights</div>
	<div class="newsbody"><div class="">
<p class="">Each month the North Cedar School Board shares two or three key highlights of our monthly board meetings. These takeaways are messages that the board collectively feels are important for the public to know.</p>
<p class="">At the April 20, 2020, meeting, the board's overwhelming consensus was that the district's response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been commendable. Instead of two or three highlights this month, the focus will be on the efforts to provide continuing educational services and student meals during the crisis.</p>
<p class=""><b class="">Continuous Learning</b>. North Cedar has elected to provide voluntary educational enrichment opportunities to students through the end of the school year. This allows students to receive in-home learning materials and feedback from their teachers. Depending on the grade level and class, this may involve online assignments or activities, all-class and individual interactive video conferences, opportunities for re-assessment, and other outreach. Teachers are checking in with families and students on a weekly basis and are available throughout the week. The North Cedar staff has done a fantastic job adapting to the current environment and we also acknowledge the additional effort that facilitating this new model of learning has required of caregivers.</p>
<p class=""><b>School Nutrition</b>. During the pandemic, the school nutrition department, led by Jen Smith, along with other volunteers, has stepped up to offer breakfast and lunches for students. Fifteen to twenty volunteers prepare daily meals for nearly 450 students, with pick-up opportunities two to three times per week. This is truly a community effort, as not only food service personnel, but many teachers, associates, and other support staff are assisting to prepare and deliver meals to families. Kudos to everyone at North Cedar for coming together to meet this very important need.</p>
<p class="">The North Cedar School Board thanks our administration, teachers, staff, students, parents, and community for continuing to be strong Knights! Stay safe, everyone.</p>
<p class="">The full agenda and attachments of North Cedar School Board meetings are available at our <a href="https://simbli.eboardsolutions.com/index.aspx?S=150020" title="" alt="" target="_blank">online board app</a>. The board also posts meeting minutes online following each meeting.</p>

	<div class="newsbody"><div class="">
<p class="">North Cedar Staff, Parents, and Community,</p>
<p class="">Governor Kim Reynolds announced an extension of school closures throughout Iowa. As a result, buildings and facilities in the North Cedar Community School District will remain closed until at least Thursday, April 30.</p>
<p class="">We will continue to provide meal services and online learning resources for our students. We’ve recently received some new guidance from the Iowa Department of Education that allows us to provide more instructional opportunities to our students. We ask that you encourage your child to participate along with accessing the resources that were provided last week. We will be providing more instructional opportunities in the near future. We are also asking parents to look for upcoming communication from their elementary teacher and/or make sure their children are checking their emails daily as this will be the primary way our teachers will be communicating with students. For the latest updates, please continue to <a href="/Home" title="" alt="" target="_self">check our website</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nccsd" title="" alt="" target="_blank">Facebook page</a>.</p>
<p class="">Again, thank you for your patience and understanding as we continue to navigate through this very challenging and uncertain time. Please continue to practice social distancing, and stay at home as much as you can to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in our community.</p>
<p class="">We appreciate your patience as we work to create a positive plan for students and your continued support of the North Cedar Community School District.</p>
<p class="">Sincerely,</p>

During the fall intro to business class as well as personal finance, we gave students the opportunity to invest $100,000 (fake) in current stocks and bonds using the Stock Market Game online provided by SIFMA Foundation. Students learn to buy and sell stocks and bonds online just as if they had their own eTrade like account. Just recently the game ended and Carson was in 1st place (1 out of 188 in our region (MI, IA, IN, or OR)) earnings percentage return of 68.48%; total equity $168,479.14. Not bad for approximately six-months of investments. Super job and congratulations Carson!</p>

<p class="">At this time, we will continue to stay open to those families who are in need of childcare. We understand at this unprecedented time some of you have chosen to pull your children out for the time being. In an effort to help families through this time, we will not be charging rates while your child is gone. This will not affect your spot during this time away, either. Once we get through this, things will resume as they were before and you will have your same spot available. </p>
<p class="">With that being said, we may need to utilize your spot during the time you are not using it to assist families that are out working the "frontlines" whose daycares have closed for the time being. If you are planning to keep your child home until they open schools back up, please let me know. We ask those who are just wanting to self quarantine for two weeks and will then be returning to work and will need childcare before the schools open back up, to also let us know as soon as possible. This way I can assure you will have a spot when you need it.</p>
<div class="pom-container">
<p class="">We will be postponing the rate changes that were supposed to take effect on April 1 until we are through this.</p>
<div class="pom-container">
<p class="">As a reminder for those who have school age children, we will bill these days as no school days. If you plan to attend part time, please let us know what days. We will set these days, as we are trying to utilize our space as best as possible and help those we can.</p>
<div class="">
<p class="">We also have some new precautions and protocols in place due to COVID-19. You can view all of these in our <a href="https://tb2cdn.schoolwebmasters.com/accnt_13185/site_13186/Documents/Daycare-Procedures-and-Protocols.pdf" title="" alt="" target="_blank">protocol and precaution letter to parents</a>.</p>

	<div class="newsbody"><div class="">
<p class=""></p>
<p class="">Each month, the North Cedar School Board will be sharing two or three key highlights of our monthly board meetings. These takeaways are messages that the board collectively feels are important for the public to know. </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""><strong>Here are the highlights from the March 16, 2020, meeting:</strong></p>
<p class=""><strong>COVID-19 Response</strong></p>
<p class="">The community show of support during the COVID-19 pandemic has been remarkable. District administration, teachers, staff, parents, students, and community members, have shown unity in the current and uncertain times. The North Cedar School Board thanks you for your solidarity and for continuing to be strong, Knights!</p>
<p class=""><strong>Sharing Agreements and Early Retirement</strong></p>
<p class="">While faced with continuous enrollment and budget challenges over the last several years, we have entered into several sharing agreements with neighboring school districts to share teachers, directors, and administration. Existing agreements will continue for another year resulting in salary and benefit savings and state operational sharing dollars of approximately $260,000. These cost savings allow North Cedar to reduce expenses, yet maintain valuable programs for our students. The board also approved an early retirement request for Jody Montz. We thank her and all staff for their dedication to our students.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Public Involvement</strong></p>
<p class="">Members of the public and students attended the meeting to advocate for a cause of concern to them. We applaud their participation in the meeting and the support they showed for each other.</p>

	<div class="nl-title">Coronavirus Update</div>
	<div class="newsbody"><div class="">
<p class="">Dear Parent/Guardian:</p>
<p class="">We understand that the novel coronavirus, now known as COVID-19, is causing much anxiety in our community, state, and the world. North Cedar Community School District is working closely with Cedar County Public Health and the Iowa Department of Public Health (IDPH) to ensure the health and safety of our students and staff.</p>
<p class=""><strong>What we know</strong></p>
<p class="">The virus causing COVID-19 is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified and causes a respiratory illness ranging from a mild cold-like illness to severe respiratory disease.</p>
<p class="">Similar to influenza, the people who are most likely to have severe disease and complications from COVID-19 are either elderly, very young, or those with other chronic or underlying medical conditions.</p>
<p class="">There is no vaccine or treatment currently available for COVID-19, so prevention is very important.</p>
<p class="">Currently, there are eight confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Iowa. Experts predict there will eventually be community spread. IDPH, Cedar County Public Health, and North Cedar Community School District are preparing for when/if this happens.</p>
<p class=""><strong>How the Virus Spreads</strong></p>
<p class="">There is evidence that COVID-19 is spreading primarily the same way the common cold or flu spreads. This is through respiratory droplets that come when someone coughs or sneezes.</p>
<p class="">People who are most at risk of becoming infected with COVID-19 are those who have been in close contact (within about six feet) with someone who has the disease. </p>
<p class="">People are most contagious when they are most symptomatic (the sickest).</p>
<p class=""><strong>What Can You Do Now</strong></p>
<p class=""></p>
<ul class="">
<li class="">Keep children home when they are sick.</li>
<li class="">Students (and parents/guardians) who are ill, especially with acute respiratory symptoms (not allergies or chronic conditions), should stay home. </li>
<li class="">Teach your children to always cover their cough and sneezes with a tissue or elbow.</li>
<li class="">Remind them to wash their hands with soap and water (or use hand sanitizer) after they touch their face, use the restroom, and before they eat.</li>
<li class="">Tell children to avoid touching their mouths and nose since that is how germs get into the body.</li>
<li class="">Clean frequently touched surfaces and objects (everyday household disinfectants are fine).</li>
<li class="">Enhance the cleaning of high touch surfaces like doorknobs, toilet handles, and sink handles.</li>
<li class="">Plan for when community spread occurs.</li>
<li class="">Ensure you have a plan to designate a caregiver, such as a family member or neighbor, for a sick child(ren) if you can’t stay home.</li>
<li class="">Know your child’s school plan to communicate with you when needed, such as robocalls, email, or checking their website. </li>
